# HyperionDev_Data_Science_
This is a repository of the completed tasks that I have picked during my HyperionDev Data Science Bootcamp

I've added all the levels I went through during this bootcamp, starting with 
1. Python For Data Science - An introductory level to learning Python
2. Data Analytucs and Exploration - This level contained and lessons and tasks on creating datasets using panda, Data Visualization, sql database management using python and many more
3. Machine Learning - This is a more advanced level of Data Science to which we get to learn how to run algorithms, deep learning, Assisted learning vs unassisted learning and Keras,etc.

Please do scroll through to see what I've created and accomplished during this bootcamp and the level I have reached when it comes to data science.

I'm still learning till this day and applying the knowledge I obtained to my current job at IEE.
